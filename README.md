> Keeping track of real estate

Realtool is a webapp for landlords that allows users to register their property, calculate mortgage payments, estimate propery values (using Zillow's API),
keep track of expenses and create custom tenant application forms. It's made entirely with Django (no front-end framework).

## What I've learned

In this project, I learned about using API's with Django and many ways of persisting data. I also used a wide variety of Django's advanced features; complex views,
dynamic form rendering, and more. Another useful thing I learned was TDD (Test Driven Development) as a style of building my application. I put a great emphasis in testing
particularly for this project to expand my skills as a developer.
